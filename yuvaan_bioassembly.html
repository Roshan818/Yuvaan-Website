    <h1>BioAssembly</h1>
    The Bio assembly module of YUVAAN is designed to collect the sample from Martian Lava tubes and perform
    life-detection tests onboard testing. <br>
    Our module will perform these three Sub-tasks: <br>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>Sample Collection</li>
        <li>Testing</li>
        <li>Sensing</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sample Collection</h2>
    <br> The soil in the lava tube is not in its loose form, so to collect the sample, we will use a drill attached to a
    screw for varying lengths. The endpoint of the drill's motor has two cylindrical rods that join the drill with the
    vertically placed screw slider system, which is used for the vertical movement of the drill. Our collection box is
    fixed to a servo motor for rotating the box in a horizontal plane. The tray is joined with a horizontally placed
    screw slider used for the trayâ€™s movement in the horizontal direction. <br>
    <h2>Testing</h2><br> We will check the presence of proteins, Nitrates, and Lipids for life detection because it is
    considered the base of any organic lifeform. The flowchart shows our workflow and how our rover will perform all the
    required tests. The testing task is accomplished by a rectangular container divided into eight subparts in which
    each part has its pump and a chemical associated with it for the required experiments. After the tests, the
    spectrometer will observe the colors, and the micro cam monitors the soil to predict its type. And finally help in
    detection of life. <br>
    <h4>Testing Mechanism</h4>
    The collected soil samples in the box placed on the tray are moved backward (in the
    horizontal plane to ground) to reach exactly below its desired chemical for a particular experiment. The chemical is
    dropped on the soil sample, which changes its color. There is a light source in between the sample collection boxes
    and spectrometer. As soon as there is a change in the color of the soil sample, the spectrometer shows a change in
    its wavelength graph. <br>
    <h2>Sample detection tests</h2><br> To detect the peptide bonds in protein Biuret Reagent is used which turns the
    color to purple, nitrates are confirmed using Diphenylamine Nitrate Test which gives a blue coloration, and lipid is
    confirmed by Sudan IV Stain Test which turns the soil sample reddish orange. <br>
    <h2>Sensing</h2> <br>
    We will be sensing temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, some gases, and
    moisture in the soil. <br>
    The different sensors that we are using are shown in the circuit below: <br>
    <h4>Sensors for Control:</h4>
    <br>
    These sensors will help the rover to navigate, and these include: <br>
    <ul type="square">
        <li>For navigation, we are deploying an accelerometer and gyroscope</li>
        <li>To measure temperature and account for heat loss, we are using thermocouples and heat flux sensors.</li>

    </ul>
