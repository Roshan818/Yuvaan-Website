    <h2>MECHANICAL MODULE</h2>
    <p>The Mechanical module of YUVAAN_IITG is responsible for making the structure of the rover such that it can
        maneuver over the Martian surface efficiently by traversing through obstacles, supporting other modules, and is
        able to perform all the tasks required to complete this mission. The main parts made by the module are as
        follows: <br>
    <ol>
        <li> Aluminium Chassis frame</li>
        <li> Rocker Bogie suspension</li>
        <li> Robotic arm </li>
        <li> Honey-Comb Wheel</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>CHASSIS</h3>
    <p>Chassis is a major component of a Rover. It consists of internal framework that supports man-made object. The
        Rover chassis is tasked with keeping all components together while driving and transferring vertical and lateral
        loads, caused by acceleration, on the chassis through suspension and the wheels. Chassis is made from aluminium
        and it supports the load of the entire bot efficiently.</p>
    <h3>SUSPENSION</h3>
    <p>Wheeled locomotionâ€™s main component is its suspension mechanism which connects the wheels to the main body or
        platform. We have used a rocker bogie suspension system <br>
    <ul>
        <li>With this kind of suspension, the typical reaction of the six wheels is distributed uniformly. </li>
        <li>This suspension system can overcome one-and-a-half-wheel diameter height obstacles. </li>
        <li>It uses an extra set of wheels to provide more forward thrust. </li>
        <li>The suspension is on backward so that the rover can back out of anything it drives into.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>WHEEL</h3>
    <p>Wheels will be needed for exploration, construction, and other surface operations. The design of the wheel was
        selected based upon the results from the research into what is currently being used on rover wheels and into the
        state of the art and combining this with the results from the analytical study. Taking the advantages from I
        robot wheel and Boston robotics wheel a new honeycomb wheel design was developed. Hexagonal cell structures are
        known to be Flexible in both axial and shear loadings. In order to provide an even greater measure of load
        distribution to the plurality of spokes, the preferred embodiment of the rim includes a central wall. The
        central wall extends from outer rim to inner rim and is perpendicular to both outer rim and inner rim.</p>
    <h3>ROBOTIC ARM</h3>
    <p>The Robotic arm is responsible for interaction on the Martian surface and the major functions of the arm include
        lifting loads, removing obstacles, and collecting samples. We designed the frame that consists of two links made
        of trusses which are connected via the help of ball bearings for smooth motion.</p>
    <p>A linear actuator is used to control the motion in the vertical direction and motion in-plane is controlled by a
        gear at the base which is rotated by a motor through a conveyor belt. We chose this design due to the following
        reasons:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>It is easier to integrate with the arm and is easier to control.</li>
        <li>Provide more strength in lifting objects.</li>
        <li>Lower cost than the other alternatives.</li>
    </ul>
